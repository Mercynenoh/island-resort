        <p>This stunning resort on the island of Zanzibar combines the scenic qualities and escapist nature of Bohol facing the Mindanao Sea with the high standards and myriad facilities synonymous with Filipino hospitality. Yet whilst it features almost 15 single-detached luxury villas, their varying locations along the beach front mean tranquillity and privacy can still be readily attained.</p>
